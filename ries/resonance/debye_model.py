r"""Debye model

The Debye model (see, e.g., Ref. :cite:`LandauLifshitz1980`) is an approximation for the specific \
heat of a harmonic solid, which assumes that the frequency distribution 
:math:`P^\mathrm{Debye} \left( \omega \right)` of the oscillators is 
given by:

.. math:: P^\mathrm{Debye} \left( \omega \right) = \frac{9 N k_B \omega^2}{\omega_\mathrm{D}} ~~~ \left( \omega \leq \omega_\mathrm{D}\right)

Here, :math:`N` is the number of particles in the solid, :math:`k_B` is the Boltzmann constant, 
and :math:`\omega_\mathrm{D}` is a cutoff frequency that is specific for the material of interest.
The Debye model interpolates between the :math:`T^3` law at low temperatures to the Dulong-Petit 
law at high temperatures.

The quantity

.. math:: T_\mathrm{D} = \hbar \omega_\mathrm{D}

is called the Debye temperature.
In a solid for which the Debye model is a good approximation, it can be shown :cite:`Lamb1939` 
that the particles move with a Maxwell-Boltzmann velocity distribution at an effective temperature

.. math:: T_\mathrm{eff} = 3 T \left( \frac{T}{T_\mathrm{D}} \right) \int_0^{\frac{T_\mathrm{D}}{T}} t^3 \left( \frac{1}{e^t - 1} + \frac{1}{2} \right) \mathrm{d}t

which is larger than the thermodynamic temperature :math:`T`.

Given values of :math:`T` and :math:`T_\mathrm{D}`, this module provides a function that solves 
the integral above numerically.

In addition, a dictionary of Debye temperatures at room temperature (`room_temperature_T_D`) 
from an online compilation 
:cite:`KnowledgeDoor2020` is provided.
The keys of the dictionary are the respective element symbols.
For example, for the Debye temperature of boron, one would type:

::

    from ries.resonance.debye_model import room_temperature_T_D
    
    print(room_temperature_T_D['B'])
"""

import numpy as np
from scipy.integrate import quad


def effective_temperature_debye_approximation(T, T_D):
    """Debye model for the effective temperature

    Given the thermodynamic temperature and the Debye temperature, this function calculates the
    effective temperature of the material.
    The defining integral is solved numerically using `scipy.integrate.quad`.

    Parameters:

    - `T`, float or array_like, thermodynamic temperature in K.
    - `T_D`, float or array_like, Debye temperature in K.

    Returns:

    - float or array_like, effective temperature in K.

    Exceptions:

    - `ZeroDivisionError`, if a value of exactly 0 is entered for the thermodynamic temperature.
